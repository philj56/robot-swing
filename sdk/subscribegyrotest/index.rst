Reacting to an event: subscribegyro
============================

:ref:`\<\< return to examples index <example-index>`

NAOqi framework allows event-based programming: it is possible to define a

the event is raised.

In this section, we will demonstrate how to implement a callback function on a
simple event, raised when the right subscribegyro is pressed.
